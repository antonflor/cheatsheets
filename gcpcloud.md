### GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Cheat Sheet

#### Introduction to GCP
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products.

- **Purpose**: Offers services for computing, storage, networking, Big Data, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as cloud management, security, and developer tools.

#### Core GCP Services
**Compute Engine**
- Provides scalable virtual machines.
- Use Cases: Hosting web applications, running backend servers.

**App Engine**
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) for building scalable web applications and mobile backends.
- Use Cases: Building and deploying applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

**Cloud Storage**
- Object storage service for storing and accessing data.
- Use Cases: Storing application data, backups, and disaster recovery.

**Cloud SQL**
- Managed relational database service.
- Supported Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server.

**BigQuery**
- Serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective multi-cloud data warehouse.
- Use Cases: Business intelligence, data analysis, and reporting.

#### Networking Services
**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
- Provides networking functionality to the cloud resources.
- Use Cases: Network isolation and protection, subnets, IP ranges, network routes, and firewalls.

**Cloud Load Balancing**
- Fully distributed, software-defined, managed service for all your traffic.
- Use Cases: Distributing user traffic across multiple instances.

**Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network)**
- Uses Google's globally distributed edge points to accelerate content delivery.
- Use Cases: Delivering web and video content with speed and reliability.

#### Advanced Services
**Kubernetes Engine**
- Managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Google infrastructure.
- Use Cases: Running containerized applications.

**Cloud Functions**
- Event-driven serverless compute platform.
- Use Cases: Building and connecting cloud services with code.

**Cloud AI and Machine Learning**
- Integrated AI and machine learning services ranging from pre-trained models to customizable ML tools.
- Use Cases: Implementing machine learning models for various applications.

#### Security and Identity Services
**Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
- Manages access control to GCP resources.
- Use Cases: Defining who (identity) has what access (role) to which resource.

**Cloud Security Command Center**
- Comprehensive security management and data risk platform for GCP.
- Use Cases: Preventing and responding to threats to your GCP assets.

**Cloud Key Management Service**
- Cloud-hosted key management service integrated with IAM and audit logging.
- Use Cases: Managing encryption for your cloud services.

#### Developer and Management Tools
**Cloud SDK**
- Command-line interface for Google Cloud Platform products and services.
- Use Cases: Managing GCP resources and services via the command line.

**Stackdriver**
- Provides monitoring, logging, and diagnostics.
- Use Cases: Monitoring the performance and health of your applications.

**Cloud Build**
- Continuous integration, delivery, and deployment platform.
- Use Cases: Building, testing, and deploying software.
