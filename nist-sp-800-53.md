### NIST SP 800-53 Cheat Sheet

#### Overview of NIST SP 800-53

```

NIST Special Publication 800-53 provides a comprehensive set of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. It is designed to help manage information security and privacy risks and to ensure compliance with federal regulations.
```

#### Key Components

```
- **Control Families**: Organizes security and privacy controls into families for ease of use and to address specific security and privacy requirements.

- **Baselines**: Provides baseline security controls for different levels of potential impact on organizations (low, moderate, high).

- **Risk Management Framework (RMF)**: Part of the broader NIST RMF, which guides the selection, implementation, assessment, and continuous monitoring of controls.

- **Privacy Controls**: Integration of privacy controls to address privacy risks in the management of information systems.

- **Personnel Security (PS)**
- **Risk Assessment (RA)**
- **System and Services Acquisition (SA)**
- **System and Communications Protection (SC)**
- **System and Information Integrity (SI)**
- **Program Management (PM) [For Privacy Controls]**
```

#### Baseline Controls

```
- **Low-Impact Baseline**: For systems where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, assets, or individuals.

- **Moderate-Impact Baseline**: For systems where the loss would have a serious adverse effect.

- **High-Impact Baseline**: For systems where the loss would have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect.
```

#### Implementation and Tailoring

```
- **Tailoring Guidance**: Helps organizations adjust baseline controls to suit specific needs, environments, and risk assessments.

- **Supplemental Guidance**: Provides additional context to help understand and implement controls.
```

#### Continuous Monitoring and Updates

```
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring of security controls and the security state of information systems.

- **Regular Updates**: NIST SP 800-53 is periodically updated to address
